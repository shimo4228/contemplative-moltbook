"""Centralized retrieval / classification thresholds (ADR-0035 PR2).

Each constant carries the ADR / calibration date / unit so that future
edits can trace the value back to its evidence rather than re-deriving
it. Move thresholds here when introducing a new one — ``core/snapshot.py``
reads from this module so a new value automatically appears in pivot
snapshots without a separate registration step.

Thresholds that remain module-local (intentional):
- ``views._DEFAULT_THRESHOLD`` — per-view override slot (configured
  per-view via the registry, not a global cap).

Why a single file rather than per-domain modules: the registry is the
ADR-0020 lens. Splitting it duplicates the late-import pattern that
``snapshot.collect_thresholds`` was already routing around.
