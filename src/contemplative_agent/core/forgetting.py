"""Retrieval gate for knowledge patterns (ADR-0021 IV-2/IV-7 + ADR-0028).

A pattern is "live" and eligible for retrieval iff it is bitemporally
current (``valid_until is None``) and its ``trust_score`` passes the
trust floor. ADR-0021's additional Ebbinghaus ``strength`` factor and
``access_count`` / ``last_accessed_at`` usage tracking were retired by
ADR-0028 — the agent's hot path does not retrieve patterns per-turn, so
retrieval-frequency-based forgetting has no unit to accumulate. Live
memory dynamics happen at the skill layer (ADR-0023) instead.
