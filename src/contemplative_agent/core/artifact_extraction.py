"""Shared step for resolving an LLM artifact body to a safe file path.

Both ``insight`` and ``rules-distill`` produce Markdown bodies that need
the same chain: ``extract_title → slugify → path-escape guard``. This
module hosts that chain so a fix (for example, tightening the path
guard) only needs to land in one place.

``skill-reflect`` deliberately does **not** use this helper. Its
filename comes from the existing skill file (``stats.name``), not from
the LLM body, so the title/slug step does not apply.

ADR-0035 PR3a explicitly rejects a base-class framing for the broader
"extract → validate → stage" loop. The LLM call, the marker semantics
(``_NO_CHANGE`` / ``_NO_RULES_MARKER``), the multi-output split, and the
frontmatter merge differ enough across the three callers that pulling
them into a parent re-creates the ADR-0024/0025 overgeneralization that
ADR-0030 had to withdraw. The helper here is scoped tightly to the
genuinely shared step.
