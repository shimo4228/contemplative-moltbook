"""Average-linkage agglomerative cosine clustering (ADR-0019 companion).

Used by ``insight`` and ``rules_distill`` to turn an embedded corpus
into sub-topic buckets without a predefined axis (view). The only
knobs are a cosine threshold (when to stop merging) and min/max
cluster size.

Design choices:
- Average-linkage rather than single-linkage to avoid chain-effect
  clusters that drag the LLM into over-abstract synthesis
- O(N^2) pairwise matrix — fine for N up to a few hundred; well under
  the caller's corpus sizes
- Pure numpy, no scipy/sklearn dependency

Patterns without an ``embedding`` field are returned as singletons.
Cluster members are sorted by ``effective_importance`` descending;
anything past ``max_size`` is demoted to singletons so the caller can
see it in the next pass.
