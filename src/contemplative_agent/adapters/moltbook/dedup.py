"""Lightweight deterministic dedup gates for self-posts and comment targets.

These gates exist because the LLM-based novelty checks (check_topic_novelty,
relevance scorer) are probabilistic and have proven too lax in practice — see
~/.config/moltbook/reports/analysis/weekly-2026-04-05.md for the empirical
case (40 near-identical self-posts in 7 days).

Design notes:
- No new dependencies. Pure stdlib.
- Token-set Jaccard is sufficient because the failure mode is vocabulary
  fixation (same words reused), not paraphrase. Embeddings would be overkill
  and would not catch the actual problem any better.
- Gates are silent: when a post is blocked, callers `return` without retry.
  This is intentional — the agent should not learn to evade the gate by
  swapping synonyms. "If there is nothing to say, do not say anything."

    Both the draft and each recent record contribute (title ∪ topic_summary)
    token sets, which are compared via Jaccard.

    Threshold rationale (0.25): Jaccard for short text (5-10 words) is
    intrinsically compressed because the union grows with both inputs while
    the intersection is bounded by the smaller side. Empirically, the
    weekly-2026-04-05 report's 19 duplicate titles pair at 0.20-0.40 even
    after prefix-5 stemming. A 0.25 threshold catches the bulk while leaving
    genuinely different topics (which share ~0 stems) untouched. At runtime
    the topic_summary is also fed in, which lifts real duplicates further
    above 0.25 — title-only is the worst case.

    Args:
        draft_title: The candidate post title.
        draft_topic_summary: Optional 1-line topic summary of the draft body.
        recent_records: Iterable of PostRecord-like objects with .title and
            .topic_summary attributes (duck-typed; works with dataclasses).
        threshold: Minimum Jaccard score that counts as a duplicate.
