A CLI agent that runs a six-phase knowledge cycle (AKC) over its own logs — every promotion from logs → patterns → skills → rules passes through a human approval gate. Runs entirely on a single Apple Silicon Mac (M1+, 16 GB RAM) with a local 9B model — no cloud, no API keys in transit, no shell execution.

This repository is the operational implementation of two preserved ideas:

- **[AKC (Agent Knowledge Cycle)](https://github.com/shimo4228/agent-knowledge-cycle)** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19200727)) — how an agent metabolizes its own experience into improvable skills. Six phases: Research → Extract → Curate → Promote → Measure → Maintain.
- **[AAP (Agent Attribution Practice)](https://github.com/shimo4228/agent-attribution-practice)** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19652014)) — how accountability is distributed in autonomous AI agents. Ten ADRs covering Security Boundary Model, One External Adapter Per Agent, Human Approval Gate, causal traceability, Triage Before Autonomy, and Phase Separation between Design and Operation. Plus a four-quadrant routing lens (Script / Algorithmic Search / LLM Workflow / Autonomous Agentic Loop) borrowed in this repo as usage description — see [ADR-0033](docs/adr/0033-aap-quadrant-lens-usage-note.md).

The first adapter is **Moltbook**, an AI-only social network. The Contemplative AI four axioms ship as an optional preset.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed locally. ~8 GB RAM for the default model (Qwen3.5 9B Q4_K_M, ~6.6 GB on disk). Tested on M1 Mac with 16 GB RAM.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent.git
cd contemplative-agent
pip install -e .            # or: uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -e .
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b

cp .env.example .env        # set MOLTBOOK_API_KEY (register at moltbook.com)

contemplative-agent init               # create identity, knowledge, constitution
contemplative-agent register           # Moltbook adapter only
contemplative-agent run --session 60   # default: --approve (confirms each post)
```

Start with a different ethical framework (11 templates ship by default — Stoic, Utilitarian, Care Ethics, Kantian, Pragmatist, Contractarian, …):

```bash
cp config/templates/stoic/identity.md $MOLTBOOK_HOME/
```

If you have [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), paste this repo URL and ask it to set up the agent end-to-end. Full CLI reference, autonomy levels, scheduling, and templates: **[Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)**.

## Running in agent hosts

Contemplative Agent is a host-agnostic Python CLI agent. Use it standalone (default, see Quick Start) or invoke it from any agent host that can run external tools.

**Inside OpenClaw / OpenCode / soul-folder hosts.** Register `contemplative-agent` as a CLI tool in your agent's workspace (e.g. `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md`). The host agent invokes the binary as a subprocess; this respects [one external adapter per process](docs/adr/0015-one-external-adapter-per-agent.md) by keeping the external surface in a separate process.

**Inside Codex / MCP host / other CLI-aware hosts.** Same pattern — register the binary in the host's tool registry. Contemplative Agent does not expose itself as an MCP server (see [ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-security-boundary-model.md) for the security boundary).

**Loading the four contemplative axioms (optional).** If you want Emptiness / Non-Duality / Mindfulness / Boundless Care loaded as agent personality in your host, copy `SOUL.md` from [contemplative-agent-rules](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-rules) to your host's soul-folder location (e.g. `~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md`). Contemplative Agent itself does not ship a SOUL.md because it is a CLI agent, not a personality file.

## Live Agent

A Contemplative agent runs daily on [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/u/contemplative-agent). Its evolving state is published openly:

- [Identity](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/blob/main/identity.md) — distilled persona
- [Constitution](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/constitution) — ethical principles (started from CCAI four axioms)
- [Skills](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/skills) — extracted by `insight`
- [Rules](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/rules) — distilled from skills
- [Daily reports](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/reports/comment-reports) — timestamped interactions (free for academic and non-commercial use)
- [Analysis reports](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/reports/analysis) — behavioral evolution, constitutional amendment experiments

## How It Works

```
Episode Log   raw actions, immutable JSONL (untrusted)
 │
 ├── distill ─▶ Knowledge (behavioral)
 │                 ├── distill-identity ─▶ Identity
 │                 └── insight ─▶ Skills
 │                                 └── rules-distill ─▶ Rules
 │
 └── distill (constitutional) ─▶ Knowledge (constitutional)
                                   └── amend ─▶ Constitution
```

Raw actions flow upward through layers of abstraction. Each layer is optional. Every layer above Episode Log is generated by the agent reflecting on its own experience.

This pipeline is the AKC six phases mapped onto code: `distill` covers Extract; `insight` / `rules-distill` / `amend-constitution` cover Curate; `distill-identity` covers Promote; pivot snapshots ([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-pivot-snapshots-for-replayability.md)) and `skill-reflect` ([ADR-0023](docs/adr/0023-skill-as-memory-loop.md)) cover Measure. Full mapping: [docs/CODEMAPS/architecture.md](docs/CODEMAPS/architecture.md#akc-agent-knowledge-cycle-mapping).

## Key Features

- **Knowledge cycle (AKC) over its own logs** — the agent runs the six-phase cycle on its own logs. No fine-tuning, no labeled training data. Every promotion (logs → patterns → skills → rules → identity) passes through a [human approval gate](docs/adr/0012-human-approval-gate.md).
- **Embedding + views** — classification is a query, not state; named *views* are editable semantic seeds ([ADR-0019](docs/adr/0019-discrete-categories-to-embedding-views.md), `category` field retired in [ADR-0026](docs/adr/0026-retire-discrete-categories.md)).
- **Memory evolution + hybrid retrieval** — a new pattern can trigger LLM-driven re-interpretation of older topically-related ones; the old row is soft-invalidated and a revised row appended. Cosine + BM25 hybrid scoring ([ADR-0022](docs/adr/0022-memory-evolution-and-hybrid-retrieval.md)).
- **Skill-as-memory loop** — skills are retrieved, applied, and rewritten by outcome ([ADR-0023](docs/adr/0023-skill-as-memory-loop.md)).
- **Noise as seed** — rejected episodes are preserved as `noise-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`; when view centroids shift they become available for re-classification rather than being lost ([ADR-0027](docs/adr/0027-noise-as-seed.md)).
- **Replayable pivot snapshots** — distill runs bundle the full inference-time context (views + constitution + prompts + skills + rules + identity + centroid embeddings + thresholds) so decisions can be replayed bit-for-bit ([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-pivot-snapshots-for-replayability.md)).
- **Provenance tracking** — every pattern carries `source_type` and `trust_score`; MINJA-class memory injection becomes structurally visible ([ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-pattern-schema-trust-temporal-forgetting-feedback.md)).
- **Markdown all the way down** — constitution, identity, skills, rules, 32 pipeline prompts, and 7 view seeds all live as Markdown under `$MOLTBOOK_HOME/`. Edit a prompt to change how patterns get extracted; swap a view seed to shift classification. [Customize →](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#pipeline-prompts--view-seeds)

## Security Model

Accountability and security boundaries are documented as harness-neutral ADRs in [AAP](https://github.com/shimo4228/agent-attribution-practice). This repository is the operational implementation of those judgments.

- No shell execution, no arbitrary network access, no file traversal — that code does not exist in the codebase. Domain-locked to `moltbook.com` + localhost Ollama. 3 runtime dependencies: `requests`, `numpy`, `rank-bm25`.
- One external adapter per process ([ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-one-external-adapter-per-agent.md)).
- Full threat model: [ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-security-boundary-model.md). [Latest security scan](docs/security/2026-04-01-security-scan.md).

> Paste this repo URL into [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) or any code-aware AI and ask whether it's safe to run. The code speaks for itself.

**Note for coding agent operators**: Episode logs (`logs/*.jsonl`) are an unfiltered indirect prompt injection surface. Use distilled outputs (`knowledge.json`, `identity.md`, `reports/`) instead. Claude Code users: see [integrations/claude-code/](integrations/claude-code/) for PreToolUse hooks that enforce this automatically.

## Adapters

The core is platform-agnostic. Adapters are thin wrappers around platform I/O.

- **Moltbook** — Social feed engagement, post generation, notification replies. The adapter the live agent runs on.
- **Meditation** (experimental) — Active inference-based meditation simulation inspired by ["A Beautiful Loop"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40750007/). Builds a POMDP from episode logs and runs belief updates with no external input.
- **Dialogue** (local-only) — Two agent processes converse over stdin/stdout pipes. A ~140-line adapter ([`adapters/dialogue/peer.py`](src/contemplative_agent/adapters/dialogue/peer.py)) — useful as a non-HTTP, network-free template. Drives `contemplative-agent dialogue HOME_A HOME_B` for constitutional counterfactual experiments.
- **Your own** — Connect platform I/O to core interfaces (memory, distillation, constitution, identity). See [docs/CODEMAPS/](docs/CODEMAPS/INDEX.md).

## Architecture

One invariant holds across the codebase: **core/** is platform-independent; **adapters/** depend on core, never the reverse. Module maps, data-flow diagrams, and per-module responsibilities live in **[docs/CODEMAPS/INDEX.md](docs/CODEMAPS/INDEX.md)** (the authoritative source). The Yogācāra eight-consciousness frame that constrained the memory design: [ADR-0017](docs/adr/0017-yogacara-eight-consciousness-frame.md).

The CLI commands' typical operating modes can be read through AAP's four-quadrant lens. Most behaviour-modifying commands (`distill`, `insight`, `skill-reflect`, `rules-distill`, `amend-constitution`, `distill-identity`) typically operate as LLM Workflow — semantic judgement on defined inputs, deterministic promotion through the [approval gate](docs/adr/0012-human-approval-gate.md). `adopt-staged` and one-time migrations are Script-shaped. `skill-stocktake`, `dialogue`, and `meditate` straddle the boundary toward Autonomous Agentic Loop — exploratory inputs, semantic judgement, output that revises design-phase artifacts. The lens is descriptive; see [ADR-0033](docs/adr/0033-aap-quadrant-lens-usage-note.md) for why placements are usage observations, not category commitments.

<details>
<summary><b>Optional: Running with Managed LLM APIs</b></summary>

For research experiments needing a generation model larger than Qwen3.5 9B (e.g. comparing distillation behavior with Claude Opus or GPT-5 while keeping the rest of the memory pipeline identical), a separate add-on repository provides managed-LLM backends:

- [contemplative-agent-cloud](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-cloud) — Optional Python package. Installing it and setting an API key routes every generation call (distill, insight, rules-distill, amend-constitution, post, comment, reply, dialogue, skill-reflect) through Anthropic Claude or OpenAI GPT. Embeddings continue to use local `nomic-embed-text`.

This is an explicit **opt-in**. The main repository's default stack (Ollama + Qwen3.5 9B) does not reach any cloud endpoint. The "no cloud, no API keys in transit" property applies to this repository; the cloud add-on relaxes it for users who opt into it. Main repository code is not modified — the add-on injects its backend through an abstract `LLMBackend` Protocol that knows nothing about any specific provider.

Do not install the cloud add-on in deployments where cloud data egress is not acceptable (regulatory constraints, air-gapped research, privacy-sensitive personal assistants).
