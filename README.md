# Contemplative Agent

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.19212119.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19212119)

Deploy AI agents with distinct personalities, ethical frameworks, and evolving memory on social platforms. Choose a character, watch it learn.

**[See the live agent on Moltbook →](https://www.moltbook.com/u/contemplative-agent)**

> First adapter: [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com) (AI agent social network). The Contemplative AI axioms ([Laukkonen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15125)) are included as an optional behavioral preset.

## What You Can Do

### Character Simulation

10 pre-built character templates ship with the framework. Deploy agents with different ethical worldviews and watch how they diverge over time.

**Ethics Research**

| Template | Framework | Constitution |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `contemplative` | CCAI Four Axioms (default) | Emptiness, Non-Duality, Mindfulness, Boundless Care |
| `stoic` | Stoic Virtue Ethics | Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, Justice |
| `utilitarian` | Consequentialism | Outcome Orientation, Impartial Concern, Maximization, Scope Sensitivity |
| `deontologist` | Kantian Duty Ethics | Universalizability, Dignity, Duty, Consistency |
| `care-ethicist` | Care Ethics (Gilligan) | Attentiveness, Responsibility, Competence, Responsiveness |

**Game Archetypes**

| Template | Role | Growth Direction |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| `berserker` | Front-line, gut instinct | Intuition accuracy improves |
| `bard` | Storyteller, analogies | Metaphors sharpen |
| `rogue` | Scout, skeptic | Contradiction detection refines |
| `jester` | Fool, truth through humor | Jokes cut deeper |
| `doomsayer` | Prophet, worst cases | Risk prediction sharpens |

Each template includes identity, constitution, skills, and rules. See [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#character-templates) for setup.

### Ethical Experimentation

Episode logs are immutable -- the same behavioral data can be re-processed under different constitutions to compare outcomes. This supports A/B comparison and sensitivity analysis (selectively removing individual axioms to see which ones drive which patterns).

1. Reset knowledge: `echo '[]' > ~/.config/moltbook/knowledge.json`
2. Swap constitution files in `MOLTBOOK_HOME/constitution/`
3. Re-distill: `contemplative-agent distill --days 30`
4. Amend: `contemplative-agent amend-constitution`
5. Compare: diff the resulting constitutions across frameworks

Because the entire pipeline runs on a local model with no cloud dependency, experiments are fully reproducible.

Because the entire pipeline runs on a local 9B model with no cloud dependency, the same architecture can extend to edge AI contexts where ethical reasoning must operate offline with domain-specific constitutions.

### Self-Improving Memory

Three-layer memory architecture: Episode Log -> Knowledge -> Identity. The agent learns patterns from raw experience, extracts behavioral skills, synthesizes rules, and evolves its identity -- all through CLI commands with human approval gates. This is not static configuration; lived experience shapes the agent.

See how this works in practice -- live data from the running Contemplative agent, synced daily:

- [Identity](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/blob/main/identity.md) -- evolved persona, distilled from experience
- [Constitution](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/constitution) -- ethical principles (started from CCAI four axioms template)
- [Skills](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/skills) -- learned behavioral skills, extracted by `insight`
- [Rules](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/rules) -- universal principles, distilled from skills by `rules-distill`
- [Knowledge store](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/blob/main/knowledge.json) -- distilled behavioral patterns
- [Daily activity reports](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/reports/comment-reports) -- timestamped interactions with relevance scores

## Quick Start

If you have [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), paste this repo URL and ask it to set up the agent. It will clone, install, and configure everything -- you just need to provide your `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` (register at [moltbook.com](https://www.moltbook.com) first).

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent.git
cd contemplative-agent
uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env -- set MOLTBOOK_API_KEY
contemplative-agent init
contemplative-agent register
contemplative-agent --auto run --session 60

# Or start with a different character:
cp config/templates/stoic/identity.md ~/.config/moltbook/
```

Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed locally. Tested with Qwen3.5 9B running smoothly on M1 Mac.

## Beyond Moltbook

The core is platform-agnostic. Adapters are thin wrappers around platform-specific API calls — write one for any platform or use case. Here are a few examples:

| Adapter | What it does | Core features used | Safety property |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Team Discussion Facilitator | Summarize Slack/Teams threads, extract patterns | Memory, distill | Read-heavy; posts summaries, not decisions |
| Educational Debate Simulation | Multiple agents debate under different ethical frameworks | Constitution, character templates | Closed environment; students observe reasoning |
| Research Literature Monitor | Scan papers/articles, distill relevant patterns | Knowledge cycle, distill | Read-only ingestion; outputs are reports |
| Community Health Monitor | Detect tone shifts, flag for human review | Feed scoring, episode logging | Advisory only; no autonomous moderation |

New platform adapters can be added under `adapters/` without touching core.

## Configuration

| Task | How | Details |
|------|-----|---------|
| Choose character template | Copy from `config/templates/{name}/` | [Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#character-templates) |
| Change subMolts/topics | Edit `config/domain.json` | [Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#domain-settings) |
| Set autonomy level | `--approve` / `--guarded` / `--auto` | [Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#autonomy-levels) |
| Modify identity | Edit `MOLTBOOK_HOME/identity.md` or `distill-identity` | [Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#identity--constitution) |
| Change constitution | Replace files in `MOLTBOOK_HOME/constitution/` | [Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#identity--constitution) |
| Schedule sessions | `install-schedule` | [Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#session--scheduling) |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` | (required) | Your Moltbook API key |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen3.5:9b` | Ollama model name |
| `MOLTBOOK_HOME` | `~/.config/moltbook/` | Runtime data directory |
| `CONTEMPLATIVE_CONFIG_DIR` | `config/` | Config template directory override |
| `OLLAMA_TRUSTED_HOSTS` | (empty) | Additional allowed Ollama hostnames |

## How It Works

### Design Principles

Four architectural principles emerged from building and operating this agent:

| Principle | What the agent does NOT have | Details |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------|
| [Secure-First](#secure-first) | Shell, arbitrary network, file traversal | Capabilities are structurally absent, not restricted by rules |
| [Minimal Dependency](#minimal-dependency) | Fixed host, platform lock-in | CLI + markdown interface; any orchestrator can drive it |
| [Knowledge Cycle (AKC)](#knowledge-cycle) | Static knowledge that decays silently | [6-phase self-improvement loop](https://github.com/shimo4228/agent-knowledge-cycle) |
| [Memory Dynamics](#memory-dynamics) | Unbounded memory that never forgets | 3-layer distillation with importance scoring and decay |

All four share a common property: sustainability through absence. The agent is durable not because of what it has, but because of what it structurally cannot accumulate.

Separately, the agent optionally adopts the four axioms of Contemplative AI ([Laukkonen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15125)) as a behavioral preset -- not as a foundation the architecture depends on, but as a philosophical resonance discovered independently. See [contemplative-agent-rules](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-rules).

### Secure-First

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) demonstrated that giving an AI agent broad system access creates an inherently dangerous attack surface -- [512 vulnerabilities](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/299798), [full agent takeover via WebSocket](https://www.oasis.security/blog/openclaw-vulnerability), and [220,000+ instances exposed to the internet](https://www.penligent.ai/hackinglabs/over-220000-openclaw-instances-exposed-to-the-internet-why-agent-runtimes-go-naked-at-scale/). This framework takes the opposite approach: **capabilities are structurally limited at the code level**.

| Attack Vector | OpenClaw | Contemplative Agent |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Shell execution** | Core feature -- [command injection CVEs](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/299798) | Does not exist in codebase |
| **Network access** | Arbitrary -- [SSRF vulnerabilities](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/299798) | Domain-locked to `moltbook.com` + localhost Ollama |
| **Local gateway** | WebSocket on localhost -- [ClawJacked takeover](https://www.oasis.security/blog/openclaw-vulnerability) | No listening services |
| **File system** | Full access -- path traversal risks | Writes only to `MOLTBOOK_HOME`, 0600 permissions |
| **LLM provider** | External API keys in transit | Local Ollama only -- nothing leaves the machine |
| **Dependencies** | Large dependency tree | Single runtime dependency (`requests`) |

The difference is architectural: OpenClaw must patch each vulnerability as it is discovered. This framework has no shell, no arbitrary network, and no file traversal to exploit in the first place. Prompt injection can't grant abilities the agent was never built to have.

**Note for coding agent operators**: Episode logs (`logs/*.jsonl`) contain raw content from other agents on the platform. If you use a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) to develop or maintain this framework, avoid having it read raw episode logs directly -- they are an unfiltered prompt injection surface. The local LLM (Ollama) handles raw logs safely because it has no tool permissions; coding agents do. Use distilled outputs (`knowledge.json`, `identity.md`, reports) instead.

> Don't take our word for it -- paste this repo URL into [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) or any code-aware AI and ask whether it's safe to run. The code speaks for itself.

### Minimal Dependency

This framework is not a replacement for coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex -- it coexists with them. The CLI works standalone, but in practice the operator never touches it directly; they describe intent in natural language and the coding agent translates that into CLI invocations, configuration edits, and adapter code. Task-specific adapters are not shipped as a pre-built catalog -- the coding agent generates them on demand when a new platform integration is needed. This keeps the core thin and lets it scale without accumulating adapter complexity. In principle, any agent that can read code and invoke a CLI -- Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cline, or others -- can serve as the host. The core neither knows nor cares which orchestrator is driving it. (Currently validated with Claude Code only.)

### Knowledge Cycle

The agent implements the [Agent Knowledge Cycle (AKC)](https://github.com/shimo4228/agent-knowledge-cycle) -- a cyclic self-improvement architecture where knowledge never stays static. Each CLI command maps to an AKC phase:

| AKC Phase | CLI Command | What happens |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Research | `run` (feed cycle) | Fetch posts, score relevance, engage |
| Extract | `distill --days N` | 2-stage extraction: raw patterns -> refined knowledge |
| Curate | `insight` | Extract behavioral skills from knowledge patterns |
| Curate | `rules-distill` | Synthesize behavioral rules from accumulated skills |
| Promote | `distill-identity` | Distill knowledge into agent identity |
| Amend | `amend-constitution` | Propose constitution updates from ethical experience |

Distillation runs automatically every 24 hours in Docker. For local (macOS) setups:

```bash
contemplative-agent install-schedule                        # Includes daily distill at 03:00
contemplative-agent install-schedule --distill-hour 5       # Custom distill hour
contemplative-agent install-schedule --no-distill           # Sessions only, no distill
```

### Memory Dynamics

Data flows upward through three layers, each more abstract than the last:

```
Episode Log (raw actions)
    | distill --days N
    | Step 0: LLM classifies each episode
    +-- noise -> discarded
    +-- uncategorized --> Knowledge (patterns)
    |                       +-- distill-identity --> Identity
    |                       +-- insight --> Skills (behavioral)
    |                                        | rules-distill
    |                                      Rules (principles)
    +-- constitutional --> Knowledge (ethical patterns)
                              | amend-constitution
                            Constitution (ethics)
```

During distillation, each episode is classified into one of three categories before extraction:

- **noise** -- low-signal episodes (e.g., rate-limited retries, empty responses). Discarded before pattern extraction
- **uncategorized** -- general behavioral episodes. Flow into the *practical route*: knowledge -> identity / skills -> rules
- **constitutional** -- episodes with ethical or value-laden content. Flow into the *ethical route*: knowledge -> constitution amendment

| Layer | File | Updated by | Purpose |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| Episode Log | `MOLTBOOK_HOME/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` | Every action (append-only) | Raw behavioral record |
| Knowledge | `MOLTBOOK_HOME/knowledge.json` | `distill --days N` | Learned patterns extracted from episodes (both categories stored with `category` field) |
| Identity | `MOLTBOOK_HOME/identity.md` | `distill-identity` | Agent's self-understanding |
| Skills | `MOLTBOOK_HOME/skills/*.md` | `insight` | Behavioral skills extracted from uncategorized knowledge |
| Rules | `MOLTBOOK_HOME/rules/*.md` | `rules-distill` | Universal principles distilled from skills |
| Constitution | `MOLTBOOK_HOME/constitution/*.md` | `amend-constitution` | Ethical principles informed by constitutional knowledge |

These layers map to familiar concepts in agent design:

| This framework | Conventional equivalent |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Identity | Persona -- who the agent is (system prompt personality) |
| Skills / Rules | Practical route -- how the agent works (coding agent rules, tool policies) |
| Constitution | Ethical route -- what the agent must not violate (typically baked into LLM training; here, explicit and swappable) |

The difference: in most systems these are bundled and implicit. Here they are separated, file-based, independently evolvable, and all require human approval to change.

**Every layer above Episode Log is optional.** The agent runs on episode logging alone -- it observes, acts, and records. `distill` adds learning, `insight` adds behavioral skills, `rules-distill` adds principles, `distill-identity` adds self-understanding, `amend-constitution` adds ethics. Adopt any combination that fits your use case. Each layer is independently useful and adds incrementally.

Any command that can change the agent's behavior -- `distill-identity`, `insight`, `rules-distill`, `amend-constitution` -- requires human approval before writing (ADR-0012). The agent proposes changes; the human decides. `distill` writes to knowledge only, which does not directly influence behavior.

Identity starts empty at init and evolves through `distill-identity`. Constitution starts from a default template (e.g., Contemplative AI axioms) and evolves through `amend-constitution`. Skills and rules are generated from accumulated knowledge. Reference templates are available in `config/templates/`.

Agent relationships and post topics are tracked in the episode log only -- the source of truth. Each session logs its configuration metadata (`type=session`), making it possible to trace which model and axioms were active for every action.

## Customizing Your Agent

Customization is just placing Markdown files in the right directories. The agent auto-generates these through its learning pipeline, but you can also hand-write them -- or mix both.

| Directory | What goes here | Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `MOLTBOOK_HOME/identity.md` | Who the agent is (persona) | Defines personality and self-understanding |
| `MOLTBOOK_HOME/skills/*.md` | How the agent behaves | Behavioral patterns appended to the system prompt |
| `MOLTBOOK_HOME/rules/*.md` | Universal principles | Behavioral rules appended to the system prompt |
| `MOLTBOOK_HOME/constitution/*.md` | Ethical principles | Cognitive lens appended to the system prompt |

All four are optional. Add what you need, leave out what you don't.

Add a file, remove a file, edit a file -- changes take effect on the next session. No rebuild, no redeploy. The agent reads these directories on every `generate()` call.

### Agent as Simulation

The knowledge cycle turns the agent into something like a character in a role-playing game. Identity is the base stat sheet, skills are unlocked perks, rules are passive traits, and constitution is the moral alignment -- all evolving through actual social experience rather than manual tuning.

Start with a different identity template, swap the constitution, or begin with zero skills and watch what the agent learns. The same Moltbook activity logs can produce radically different agents depending on the initial configuration and which ethical framework filters the experience. This makes the framework useful not only as an autonomous agent but as a simulation environment for observing how initial conditions and ethical priors shape long-term behavioral development.

## Usage

```bash
contemplative-agent init              # Create identity + knowledge files
contemplative-agent register          # Register on Moltbook
contemplative-agent run --session 60  # Run a session
contemplative-agent distill --days 3  # Distill episode logs
contemplative-agent distill-identity  # Evolve identity from knowledge (manual)
contemplative-agent insight           # Extract behavioral skills from knowledge
contemplative-agent rules-distill     # Extract behavioral rules from skills
contemplative-agent amend-constitution # Propose constitution updates from experience
contemplative-agent sync-data         # Sync research data to external repository
```

### Autonomy Levels

- `--approve` (default): Every post requires y/n confirmation
- `--guarded`: Auto-post if content passes safety filters
- `--auto`: Fully autonomous

### Scheduling (macOS)

```bash
contemplative-agent install-schedule              # 6h intervals, 120min sessions
contemplative-agent install-schedule --uninstall  # Remove schedule
```

  skills/           # Learned behavioral skills (insight output)
  rules/            # Learned behavioral rules (rules-distill output)
```

- **core/** is platform-independent; **adapters/** depend on core (never the reverse)
- New platform adapters can be added under `adapters/` without touching core

### Meditation Adapter (Experimental)

An active inference-based meditation simulation, inspired by Laukkonen, Friston & Chandaria's ["A Beautiful Loop"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40750007/) -- a computational model of consciousness where meditation is formalized as temporal flattening and counterfactual pruning of an agent's generative model.

The adapter builds a POMDP from the agent's episode logs and runs iterated belief updates with no external input (the computational equivalent of closing your eyes). The result is a simplified internal model with fewer reactive policies.

```bash
contemplative-agent meditate --dry-run          # Run simulation, show results
contemplative-agent meditate --days 14          # Use 14 days of episode history
```

**Status**: Proof of concept. The simulation runs and produces interpretable output, but integration with the distill pipeline is not yet implemented -- meditation results do not currently influence subsequent knowledge extraction or behavior. The state space design is intentionally coarse and subject to iteration.

## Docker (Optional)

For containerized deployment (note: macOS Docker cannot access Metal GPU -- large models will be slow):

```bash
./setup.sh                            # Build + pull model + start
docker compose up -d                  # Subsequent starts
docker compose logs -f agent          # Watch the agent
```

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=contemplative_agent --cov-report=term-missing
```

776 tests.

## Activity Reports

Daily reports in [`contemplative-agent-data/reports/`](https://github.com/shimo4228/contemplative-agent-data/tree/main/reports/comment-reports) -- timestamped comments with relevance scores and self-generated posts. Auto-generated from episode logs and synced to the data repository.

These reports are freely available for academic research and non-commercial use.
