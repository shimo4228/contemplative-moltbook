## ADR Types

ADRs in this project fall into two categories with different editability rules:

**Problem-solving ADRs (emergent)**
Record reactive design decisions triggered by a concrete issue. Most ADRs in this index are of this type. They can be superseded by later ADRs that offer a better solution for the same problem.

Examples: ADR-0005 (SessionContext refactoring), ADR-0008 (two-stage distill pipeline), ADR-0009 (importance score), ADR-0016 (insight narrow / stocktake broad).

**Worldview ADRs (axiomatic)**
Record the mental models and philosophical frames that the project operates under from the start. These are *not* reactive — they are the prerequisite under which problem-solving ADRs are even formulated. Changing a worldview ADR is not the same as fixing a bug; it is altering the project's identity and requires a different kind of judgment.

Examples: ADR-0002 (paper-faithful CCAI), ADR-0007 (security boundary model), ADR-0017 (Yogācāra eight-consciousness frame).

**Rule of thumb**: If the ADR could have been written differently under a different project with the same problem, it is problem-solving. If the ADR describes a frame under which the project's problems become legible at all, it is worldview. Worldview ADRs are downstream-of-nothing; problem-solving ADRs are downstream of a worldview (even if unnamed).

## Template

When adding a new ADR, follow this format:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

## Status
accepted / superseded by ADR-XXXX / deprecated

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What was the problem

## Decision
What was decided

## Alternatives Considered
Rejected options and why

## Consequences
What resulted from this decision
```

## Guidelines

- Numbers are sequential (0001–), in chronological order
- Changes to existing ADRs are made via a new ADR that supersedes the original (never overwrite)
- Only record decisions affecting architecture, data models, or security — minor decisions need not be recorded
- Use `/sync-context` to check consistency between the ADR index and files
