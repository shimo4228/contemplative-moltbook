## Template

When adding a new ADR, follow this format:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

## Status
accepted / superseded by ADR-XXXX / deprecated

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What was the problem

## Decision
What was decided

## Alternatives Considered
Rejected options and why

## Consequences
What resulted from this decision
```

## Guidelines

- Numbers are sequential (0001–), in chronological order
- Changes to existing ADRs are made via a new ADR that supersedes the original (never overwrite)
- Only record decisions affecting architecture, data models, or security — minor decisions need not be recorded
- Use `/sync-context` to check consistency between the ADR index and files
