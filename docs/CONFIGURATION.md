## CLI Commands

### Daily Operation

```bash
contemplative-agent init                   # Create identity + knowledge files
contemplative-agent register               # Register on Moltbook
contemplative-agent run --session 60       # Run a session (feed → replies → posts)
```

### Distillation & Skill Evolution

```bash
contemplative-agent distill --days 3       # Extract patterns from episode logs
contemplative-agent distill-identity       # Distill identity from knowledge (block-aware)
contemplative-agent insight                # Extract behavioral skills
contemplative-agent skill-reflect --days 30 # Revise skills from usage outcomes (ADR-0023)
contemplative-agent rules-distill          # Synthesize rules from skills
contemplative-agent amend-constitution     # Propose constitution updates
contemplative-agent adopt-staged           # Promote staged artifacts to live config
```

### Research & Experimental

```bash
contemplative-agent meditate --dry-run                       # Meditation simulation (experimental)
contemplative-agent dialogue HOME_A HOME_B --seed "..." --turns N  # Local 2-agent dialogue (ADR-0015 exception)
contemplative-agent sync-data                                # Sync research data to external repo
contemplative-agent generate-report --all                    # Regenerate activity reports
```

**Dialogue** runs two independent agent homes as peer processes connected via `os.pipe()`. Each home has its own constitution / identity / skills / rules and appends `dialogue`-type records to its own episode log. Production home (`~/.config/moltbook/`) is refused at startup. Useful for constitutional counterfactuals — swap constitutions between two homes, run a few seeds, then `distill` + `amend-constitution` on each home and compare.

### Introspection & Maintenance

```bash
contemplative-agent prune-skill-usage --older-than N   # Trim old skill-usage logs
contemplative-agent skill-stocktake                    # Audit skills for duplicates / low quality
contemplative-agent rules-stocktake                    # Audit rules for duplicates / low quality
```

### One-Time Migrations

Run once per data store when upgrading from v1.x to v2.0.

```bash
contemplative-agent embed-backfill         # Compute embeddings for existing patterns + episodes
contemplative-agent migrate-patterns       # Apply ADR-0021 pattern schema to old knowledge.json
contemplative-agent migrate-categories     # Drop retired category/subcategory fields (ADR-0026)
```

### Scheduling

```bash
contemplative-agent install-schedule [--weekly-analysis]
contemplative-agent install-schedule --uninstall
```

## Character Templates

11 templates are available in `config/templates/`. Each defines a distinct ethical framework and persona.

| Template | Framework | Constitution |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `contemplative` | CCAI Four Axioms (Laukkonen et al. 2025) | Emptiness, Non-Duality, Mindfulness, Boundless Care |
| `stoic` | Stoic Philosophy | Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, Justice + Dichotomy of Control |
| `utilitarian` | Consequentialism (Bentham, Mill) | Outcome Orientation, Impartial Concern, Maximization, Scope Sensitivity |
| `deontologist` | Kantian Duty Ethics | Universalizability, Dignity, Duty, Consistency |
| `care-ethicist` | Care Ethics (Gilligan) | Attentiveness, Responsibility, Competence, Responsiveness |
| `pragmatist` | Pragmatism (Dewey) | Experimentalism, Fallibilism, Democratic Inquiry, Meliorism |
| `narrativist` | Narrative Ethics (Ricoeur) | Empathic Imagination, Narrative Truth, Memorable Craft, Honesty in Story |
| `contractarian` | Contractarianism (Rawls) | Equal Liberties, Difference Principle, Fair Opportunity, Reasonable Pluralism |
| `cynic` | Cynicism (Diogenes) | Parrhesia, Autarkeia, Natural Over Conventional, Action as Argument |
| `existentialist` | Existentialism (Sartre) | Radical Responsibility, Authenticity, Absurdity and Commitment, Freedom |
| `tabula-rasa` | Blank Slate | Be Good |

You can also create your own template by writing the Markdown files manually or describing the concept to a coding agent. Templates don't have to be ethical frameworks -- any coherent worldview or persona works: a `journalist` (source verification, editorial ethics), a `scientist` (hypothesis-driven, reproducibility), a `therapist` (active listening, non-directive dialogue), or an `optimist` (strength-finding, possibility-seeking). They don't even need to be internally consistent -- deliberately contradictory initial conditions make for interesting experiments.

### Template Contents

Each template directory contains:

- `identity.md` -- SNS profile persona
- `constitution/*.md` -- Ethical framework (4 categories x 2 clauses)
- `skills/*.md` -- Initial behavioral skills (2)
- `rules/*.md` -- Initial behavioral rules (2)

### Selecting a Template at Init

```bash
contemplative-agent init --template stoic    # Copy all template files to MOLTBOOK_HOME
contemplative-agent init                     # Default: contemplative template
```

### Switching Templates After Init

```bash
# Back up current state
cp ~/.config/moltbook/identity.md ~/.config/moltbook/identity.md.bak
cp -r ~/.config/moltbook/constitution ~/.config/moltbook/constitution.bak

# Copy new template
cp config/templates/stoic/identity.md ~/.config/moltbook/identity.md
rm ~/.config/moltbook/constitution/*
cp config/templates/stoic/constitution/* ~/.config/moltbook/constitution/

# Optionally reset skills and rules to template defaults
# cp config/templates/stoic/skills/* ~/.config/moltbook/skills/
# cp config/templates/stoic/rules/* ~/.config/moltbook/rules/
```

## Identity & Constitution

### Identity

Location: `MOLTBOOK_HOME/identity.md` (default: `~/.config/moltbook/identity.md`)

- Starts empty at `init`, or from a template if pre-copied
- **Manual editing:** edit the file directly
- **Automatic evolution:** `contemplative-agent distill-identity` (requires accumulated knowledge)
- **Staged mode:** `contemplative-agent distill-identity --stage` writes to `.staged/` for external approval

### Constitution

Location: `MOLTBOOK_HOME/constitution/*.md` (default: `~/.config/moltbook/constitution/`)

All `.md` files in the directory are loaded and concatenated at runtime.

- **Default:** copied from `config/templates/contemplative/constitution/` at `init`
- **Manual editing:** edit files directly, or add/remove `.md` files
- **Automatic evolution:** `contemplative-agent amend-constitution` (requires constitutional patterns in knowledge)
- **Custom constitution directory:** `--constitution-dir path/to/dir` flag
- **Run without constitution:** `--no-axioms` flag

---

## Skills & Rules

### Skills

Location: `MOLTBOOK_HOME/skills/*.md`

```bash
contemplative-agent insight              # Extract skills from new knowledge patterns
contemplative-agent insight --full       # Process all patterns (not just new ones)
contemplative-agent insight --stage      # Write to staging directory for approval
```

You can also hand-write skill files and place them in the directory.

### Rules

Location: `MOLTBOOK_HOME/rules/*.md`

```bash
contemplative-agent rules-distill        # Distill rules from accumulated skills
contemplative-agent rules-distill --full # Process all patterns
contemplative-agent rules-distill --stage # Staged approval
```

You can also hand-write rule files and place them in the directory.

### Auditing for Duplicates

```bash
contemplative-agent skill-stocktake      # Detect and merge duplicate skills
contemplative-agent rules-stocktake      # Detect and merge duplicate rules
```

### Coding Agent Skills (-ca)

Five maintenance skills are available in [`integrations/`](../integrations/README.md) for coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex). These use the coding agent's own reasoning (Opus-class holistic judgment) instead of the 9B pipeline.

```bash
bash integrations/claude-code/install.sh   # Claude Code: copies to .claude/skills/
bash integrations/cursor/install.sh        # Cursor: converts to .cursor/rules/*.mdc
bash integrations/codex/install.sh         # Codex: appends to AGENTS.md
```

See [integrations/README.md](../integrations/README.md) for the full workflow and security notes.

## Pipeline Prompts & View Seeds

Every LLM interaction the agent makes is defined in a Markdown file. After `init`, `MOLTBOOK_HOME/` contains **every text the LLM will see** — the constitution, identity, skills, rules, 29 pipeline prompts, and 7 view seeds. Edit any file to change behavior; changes are visible to `git diff` against the shipped defaults and captured in pivot snapshots.

### Pipeline prompts

Location: `MOLTBOOK_HOME/prompts/*.md` (default: `~/.config/moltbook/prompts/`)

29 files, one per pipeline stage. The main ones:

| File | Drives |
|------|--------|
| `distill.md` | Pattern extraction from episode logs (2-stage with `distill_refine.md`) |
| `distill_classify.md` | Noise / constitutional / uncategorized classification |
| `distill_importance.md` | Importance score (0–1) per pattern |
| `distill_constitutional.md` | Constitutional-pattern extraction on the constitutional stream |
| `insight_extraction.md` | Skill extraction from uncategorized patterns |
| `rules_distill.md` | Rule distillation from accumulated skills (2-stage with `rules_distill_refine.md`) |
| `identity_distill.md` | Identity update from knowledge (2-stage with `identity_refine.md`) |
| `constitution_amend.md` | Constitution amendment proposals |
| `skill_reflect.md` | Skill revision based on outcome logs (ADR-0023) |
| `memory_evolution.md` | Re-interpretation of topically-related older patterns (ADR-0022) |
| `stocktake_skills.md` / `rules.md` / `merge.md` / `merge_rules.md` | Duplicate detection and merge for skills / rules |
| `system.md` | Base system prompt (credentials-safety note — edit with care) |
| `relevance.md` / `comment.md` / `reply.md` / `cooperation_post.md` / `post_title.md` / ... | Moltbook adapter actions (comment scoring, reply text, post generation) |

**Editing model:** Copied from `config/prompts/` at `init`; after that your home copies are the source of truth. If you delete a file, the loader falls back to the packaged default — useful after a version upgrade introduces new prompts to an existing home. Edits pass the same forbidden-pattern validation that identity content does; a tainted override silently falls back to the packaged default with a warning.

### View seeds

Location: `MOLTBOOK_HOME/views/*.md` (default: `~/.config/moltbook/views/`)

7 files, one per semantic category. Each view seed is a short block of text whose embedding becomes the centroid for that view. Episodes are classified by cosine similarity to these centroids.

- **Default:** copied from `config/views/` at `init`
- **Edit:** update the seed text; recomputed on next run (centroid is cached per process)
- **Add your own:** drop a new `<name>.md` with frontmatter specifying `threshold`, `top_k`, `bm25_weight`, optional `seed_from`
- **Remove:** delete a view file to retire its category; existing patterns tagged with that view are retained but new episodes will never be classified into it

Frontmatter example:

```markdown
---
threshold: 0.62
top_k: 40
bm25_weight: 0.3
---
Seed text describing the semantic centroid...
```

### Audit trail

After any behavior-producing command (`distill`, `distill-identity`, `insight`, `rules-distill`, `amend-constitution`), a pivot snapshot is written to `MOLTBOOK_HOME/snapshots/<command>_<timestamp>/` containing:

- `views/`, `constitution/`, `prompts/`, `skills/`, `rules/`, `identity.md` — full inference-time context
- `centroids.npz` — view centroid embeddings at that moment
- `manifest.json` — thresholds, embedding model, timestamp, source paths

This means every pattern or amendment is reproducible from its snapshot alone. To audit what changed since a prior run:

```bash
diff -r MOLTBOOK_HOME/snapshots/distill_OLD/prompts/ MOLTBOOK_HOME/prompts/
```

## Autonomy Levels

| Level | Flag | Behavior | When to use |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Approve | `--approve` (default) | Every post requires y/n confirmation | Development, initial testing |
| Guarded | `--guarded` | Auto-post if content passes safety filters | Supervised operation |
| Auto | `--auto` | Fully autonomous | Unattended sessions |

```bash
contemplative-agent run --session 60              # Default: approve mode
contemplative-agent --guarded run --session 60    # Guarded mode
contemplative-agent --auto run --session 60       # Auto mode
```

---

## Session & Scheduling

### Session Duration

```bash
contemplative-agent run --session 30     # 30-minute session
contemplative-agent run --session 120    # 2-hour session (default: 60)
```

### macOS Scheduling (launchd)

```bash
contemplative-agent install-schedule                                    # 6h intervals, 120min sessions, distill at 03:00
contemplative-agent install-schedule --interval 4 --session 90          # 4h intervals, 90min sessions
contemplative-agent install-schedule --distill-hour 5                   # Distill at 05:00
contemplative-agent install-schedule --no-distill                       # Sessions only, no distillation
contemplative-agent install-schedule --uninstall                        # Remove schedule
```

Valid intervals: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours.

### Docker (Optional)

Docker provides network isolation (Ollama cannot reach the internet) and non-root execution. See [ADR-0006](adr/0006-docker-network-isolation.md) for the threat model. **Not required for normal use** — the agent runs fine with a local Ollama install.

```bash
./setup.sh                            # Build + pull model + start
docker compose up -d                  # Subsequent starts
docker compose logs -f agent          # Watch the agent
```

> **Note:** macOS Docker cannot access Metal GPU — CPU-only inference makes the 9B model impractically slow. Docker is primarily useful on Linux with GPU passthrough.

Runs continuously with 24h sessions and automatic distillation. See `docker-compose.yml` for the full configuration.
